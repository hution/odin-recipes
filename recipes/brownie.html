        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1 - Make the cookie dough and press it into a greased baking dish. </li>

            <li>Step 3 - Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean. </li>
            <li>Step 4 - Cut the brookies into bars. </li>
